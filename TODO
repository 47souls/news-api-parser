So


1) Refactor current architecture

processor needs source, parser
parser needs to understand which is format

2) Integration test

"You will test these through both unit tests and a system test"

For simple format.json
LocalDateTime.parse(dateString, DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("y-M-d H:m:s[.SSSSSS]"))

3) Use modularity in building a project

4) Use module-level testing ??

a) So module with library will have unit tests
b) Client module with have units + integrations
